Computing Area Under a Curve
===

MIPS program to find the area under a curve defined by joining straight lines between co-ordinate points given as an input. The exact problem specifications can be found [here](https://github.com/pshrey795/MIPS-Simulator/blob/main/AreaUnderCurve/Statement.pdf). Refer the [design document](https://github.com/pshrey795/MIPS-Simulator/blob/main/AreaUnderCurve/Design.pdf) for complete details regarding the algorithm and its implementation. 

Testing

For testing, refer to the [Testcases](https://github.com/pshrey795/MIPS-Simulator/tree/main/AreaUnderCurve/TestCases) sub-directory, which contains different types of testcases depending upon the name of the corresponding folder. Additionally, there is also a custom [testcase generator](https://github.com/pshrey795/MIPS-Simulator/blob/main/AreaUnderCurve/TestCases/tc_generator.py) which generates random testcases according to the specifications and a [model output generator](https://github.com/pshrey795/MIPS-Simulator/blob/main/AreaUnderCurve/TestCases/model.py) which generates the model output for this custom testcase.
